Grace is an AI sales assistant that provides automated customer support through Instagram DMs. We need instagram_manage_messages to:

1. Receive customer inquiries via Instagram DMs
2. Send automated responses to customer questions
3. Provide 24/7 customer support for small businesses
4. Handle product inquiries and sales assistance

The app demonstrates a complete "message in → auto reply out" flow for business customer engagement.

When a customer sends a DM to a connected Instagram Business account:
1. Our webhook receives the message event

## 📱 Temporary Workaround (While in Review)

Until approval, you can still test with these limitations:
- ✅ **OAuth flow**: Works fully
- ✅ **Profile fetching**: Works fully  
- ✅ **Webhook verification**: Works fully
- ⚠️ **Receiving messages**: Only works for app admins/developers
- ⚠️ **Sending replies**: Limited to test accounts

## 🎯 Expected Timeline

- **Review time**: 1-7 business days typically
- **Common outcome**: Approval (your implementation is solid)
- **If rejected**: Meta provides specific feedback for fixes

## 🔧 During Review Period

**What works now:**
- All OAuth functionality
- Profile display
- Webhook setup (ready for activation)
- Auto-reply system (for admin messages)

**What activates after approval:**
- Public message receiving
- Unrestricted auto-replies
- Full production messaging

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be specific** in your review submission
2. **Mention business use case** (customer support automation)
3. **Reference demo URLs** and test accounts
4. **Show complete functionality** in your demo

Your app is **technically perfect** - this is just Meta's approval process! 🚀
